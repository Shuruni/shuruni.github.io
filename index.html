              Having been committed to learning and applying the latest technologies since childhood, I've had the opportunity to learn about and work with a wide range of different technologies over the years across the entire tech stack. From Java, C#, C++, Python, or Node for the Backend, to HTML, CSS, Typescript, React for the Frontend, to even Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, and the like for the Infra that holds it all together! I've always been a tinkerer and deep thinker with a need to learn the inner workings of everything. My motto is that it is better to learn how something works before it breaks than have to scramble to learn it once it is already broken!

              I first came across tech on my own in middle school where I ended up using VBScript and C# to create some learning tools for my teachers. Heading into High School, I expanded my skill-set by working as a student IT support where I did cable runs and coded a utility for the offices to use for security camera view swapping and additionally worked to establish a computer science program at the high school of my own volition. In university I found myself right at home being able to study Python, Java, C++ and various other technologies. All the while I found myself researching and working on projects using what I had learned as well as applying the skills in Docker and React that I picked up during my summer internship. Even now I continue to explore and work on projects employing various technologies such as AI/ML(ASR->NLU->Traditional_API), React, Python, Kubernetes, Helm, Ansible, and more!

              I tend to spend my free time working on various personal development projects, and when I'm not, I can usually be found tinkering with my HomeLab, or Engaging with Japanese Media on YouTube or NicoNicoVideo(ニコニコ動画).
