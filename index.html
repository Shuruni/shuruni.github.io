            Hi there <span class="kaomoji">( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ</span>, How's life?
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether because you know me and I linked this site to you or you discovered it by pure chance, it appears that you've wound up on this little site of mine eh? Welcome!
          </p>
          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            I've been into tech since I was in Middle School where I taught myself VBScript and C# and created some learning tools for my teachers just for fun. Once I got to High School, I decided to take things a bit more seriously by working as a student IT support where I did cable runs and coded a utility for the offices to use for security camera view swapping. I also tried to get a computer science program started at the high school, though the plans ended up falling through so I had to continue learning on my own until I reached University. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In University I found myself right at home being able to study Python, Java, C++ and a whole slew of useful fundamental concepts. All the while I found myself researching and working on projects using what I had learned as well as applying the skills in Docker and React that I picked up during my summer internship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowadays, I tend to spend my free time tinkering with my Homelab, and when I'm not, I can usually be found working on various personal projects<!-- (See <a href="/demos">Project Demos</a>)-->, or Relaxing while watching Japanese Media(ゲーム実況、TRPG配信、アニメ、などなど).
